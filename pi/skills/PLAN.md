# Android Agent Skills Implementation Plan

This document outlines the strategy for integrating specialized Android development skills into the `pi` agent.

## Goals
1.  **Speed**: Accelerate common Android tasks (build, deploy, test) by 3x.
2.  **Accuracy**: Use specialized skills to reduce errors in ADB commands and Gradle configurations.
3.  **Discovery**: Provide a clear list of available capabilities to the user.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Tooling (Current)
- [x] `android-adb`: Device interaction.
- [x] `android-gradle`: Build system management.
- [x] `android-compose`: UI development patterns.

### Phase 2: Project Management
- [ ] `android-manifest`: Permission and component management.
- [ ] `android-resources`: Localized strings, colors, and asset management.
- [ ] `android-versions`: Version catalog (`libs.versions.toml`) management and updates.

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality
- [ ] `android-test`: Unit and UI test automation (Espresso/Compose Test).
- [ ] `android-lint`: Automatic fixing of lint issues.
- [ ] `android-perf`: Performance profiling and analysis.

### Phase 4: Release & Publishing
- [ ] `android-bundle`: App Bundle creation and analysis.
- [ ] `android-play`: Play Store metadata and release management.

## Available Skills (Reference)

| Skill Name | Description |

## Usage
Skills are automatically discovered by `pi` from `pi/skills/`. You can force load a skill using `/skill:<name>`.

Example:
`/skill:android-adb list devices`
